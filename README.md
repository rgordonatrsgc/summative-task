# Summative Task

## Overall goal

I will program a simulation of flocking behaviour as demonstrated by birds, or schools of fish.

In the sketch, a visual representation of a flock of "birds" will be shown.

The lead "bird" will follow the mouse.

The other birds will follow these rules:

1. Seperation rule: Avoid crowding your neighbours. Give the other "birds" room to avoid collisions.
2. Alignment rule: "Look" at where the other birds are going and pick a heading that is the average of everyone else's trajectories.
3. Cohesion rule: Move toward the average position of all your neighbours, to prevent the flock from dissipating.

## Sub-goals

* start the "birds" in a V-shape
* make only the "lead bird" follow the mouse
* implement seperation rule
* implement alignment rule
* implement cohesion rule
